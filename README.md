# SPMCachePrototype

The goal of this prototype is to figure out how a a CI cache for dependencies might work for Swift Package Manager. 

This links to a framework that should take about 1m to compile on my MacBook pro, which should presumably take slightly longer on a CI machine. We can use this to benchmark the effectiveness of the caching.
